        <p>
          I came to Canada last year after having finished my Bachelor's in Technology of Mechanical Engineering from India. </p>

         <p> Right after graduating, the startup I was selected for incubation by Startup Chile. <a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/chandigarh/pec-start-up-wins-rs10-lakh-458951" target="_blank">Click here to read coverage by the local media</a> I was developing Automated Hydroponic Systems and the startup was built around selling hydroponic systems and hydroponic produce. 
        </p>
        <p> After having completed the program at Startup Chile, I went back to India and joined the leading EdTech Startup of India, "Byjus". I joined in a Business Development role, primarily to understand what I could have done better in terms of business during my time in Chile. While working at Byjus I was a constant performer, topping in multiple cycles.
        </p>
        <p>  After having gotten a keen grasp of Business Fundamentals and sales pitches, I joined ClickLabs, a software development company based around selling customized software solutions for small and medium businesses. I joined in a Sales role and was given the responsibility of setting up the sales model for a new project. The project was a Tech BootCamp School and I personally registered over 200 students in 6 months.
        </p> 
        <p>   I had applied for migration to Canada after graduating and by this time my papers came through and I migrated here to further my career.
        </p>
        <p>After having come here, I have been working construction in a temporary role while polishing my coding skills. I already had some programming experience from building Automated Hydroponic Systems. 
        </p>
        <p>  Since the past year I have been learning mobile and website development and have reached reasonable proficiency. </p>
